Delighted to present the frontend of my Fictitious Portfolio Website, crafted with HTML and CSS, incorporating animation and responsiveness for an enhanced user experience.

Utilized flexbox, divs, and positioning for a dynamic website structure

Enhanced attractiveness with animation, transition, z-index,.transform, and keyframes
